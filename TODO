 TODOs: 
    - Test that 'rb' works on windows as well
    - Add more specific exceptions for common errors like
       errors for lack of Permission to read the file
    - Handle repeated entries from the same employee?
       Need to include the employee's name in this class to do so.
    - Must support already existing table
    - Consider adding some input test here
